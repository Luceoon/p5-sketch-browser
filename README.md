# P5 Sketch Browser and Viewer

Simple PHP Skript for Browsing different p5.js Sketches and easily run them.

> just put your sketches (only single js-files are supportet atm) in the "sketches"-Directory and they will be listed.

> NOTE: This application isn't really general purpose. I created it to have a better way presenting multiple p5 scripts.... so don't expect to much here. (Code is messy as hell too)
